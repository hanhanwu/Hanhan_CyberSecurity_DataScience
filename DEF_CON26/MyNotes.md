This will be my first DEF CON. I booked the flight and hotel at the end of last year, because of the discounts. I'm very excited about it, and also need to be very careful to everything. My own security is the most important.

## Preparation

### What to Remember
* <b>Don't bring any electronic device. Don't bring bank cards but just cash.</b>
* <b>Be careful to whom to talk to.</b>
  * I don't want to be part of someone's research paper, and would there be someone even worse?
* <b>About Identity</b>
  * Level 1 Info: Hotel; Transfortation; Residency
  * Level 2 Info: Name, Company, Job Title, Interest Area
  * <b>Be careful when to give business card</b>
* <b>About the party</b>
  * Check whether it's safe to attend the party. Don't take any risk.
